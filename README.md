Using what we have covered in class, write a program to play a game of Rock,Paper,Scissors.
Open the "main.py" file and add your code.

The player will be against the "computer" that will randomly choose each round.

The program must run in a loop so that it can be played multiple times.

For an extra challenge, add a score for the player and computer that increases.
